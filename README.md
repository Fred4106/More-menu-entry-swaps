# Plugin description
This plugin can:
- Swap menu entries based on the text they contain. This means you can swap menu entries that runelite's menu entry swapper won't, or in ways that it can't such as prioritizing one menu entry over another.
- Hide menu entries entirely.
- Re-order ground items.
- Has customizable hotkeys for certain swaps such withdraw/deposit in the bank, fairy ring, and occult altar.
